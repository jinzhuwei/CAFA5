## Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict the function of a set of proteins. You will develop a model trained on the amino-acid sequences of the proteins and on other data. Your work will help researchers better understand the function of proteins, which is important for discovering how cells, tissues, and organs work. This may also aid in the development of new drugs and therapies for various diseases.
